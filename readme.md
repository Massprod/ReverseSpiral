# SpiralRead - reverse spiral reading of sqMatrix
Taking Url with response of a square matrix and read it in reverse spiral mode.
Based and created for this particular [Task](https://github.com/avito-tech/python-trainee-assignment) and [Url]('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avito-tech/python-trainee-assignment/main/matrix.txt').

# TODO/REDO
Remake spiral reading [Function](https://github.com/Massprod/Test1/blob/master/test/createTestSQMatrix.py) to be more universal.
Unit testing will be good, but it's not in a task.
